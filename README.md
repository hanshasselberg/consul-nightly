# Consul Nightly

Building infrequent versions of consul for linux-386 and linux-amd64 and OSX.

## Usage

I am running:

```
./run.sh 5887242db2ebaae6c6cb9dfe68bdf078f9c1eefd
```

But you cannot do that because `run.sh` contains profile informations and details about security groups and iam roles. Let me know if you want to run it too.

## Todo

* Support windows?
